/*
 * You expected the final value to be 2,000,000,000 (because two threads each incremented the counter 1 billion times).
But the actual final value was less (1,999,790,510), meaning some increments got lost.
This loss happens because the two threads were overlapping in their reads/writes to the shared counter without coordination.
this means that instead of incremnting on order sometimes the two threads were looking at the same number, race condition
